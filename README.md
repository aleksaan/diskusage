# diskusage 
diskusage is an utility to find top largest directories on the disk.

## !!! 2021.09.24: Version 2.7.0 is now avaliable  !!!
## Assignment input parameters as environment variables (rejection of using diskusage_config.yaml file) for better compatibility with an system level utilities
## Renaming "path" parameter to "pathToScan" to avoid naming conflict with classic windows "PATH" system environment variable

## Features
- A primitive tool for getting folder(s) sizes
- Comfortable setup (yaml config)
- Supports both folders and disks as arguments
- Recursive passes through subfolders
- Calculates size of each folder
- Analyzes on defined depth of subfolders
- Sets limit how much folders will be printed in a results
- Fast
- Saves results to csv-file

## Main cons
- No any dummies protection (also pros)
- No any intelligents features (also pros)

## Releases

Releases available as single executable files â€“ just [download latest release](https://github.com/aleksaan/diskusage/releases) for your platform, unpack and run.

## Simple usage (Windows example)

Put ```diskusage.exe``` into analyzed directory, run it and get results in ```diskusage_out.txt```
It will be scanning current folder with a default settings

## Advanced usage (Windows example)

You may define input parameters of diskusage by two ways:
1. in a cmd|bash session define environment variables (like SET pathToScan=C:\) and run diskusage.exe (CLI MODE)
2. or create .env file near diskusage.exe, fill it up by needed environment variables and run diskusage.exe (USER MODE)

Example of USER MODE settings in the .env file:
```cmd
pathToScan=D:\_docs
depth=5
limit=20
units=Gb
filterByObjectType=folders&files
sizeCalculatingMethod=cumulative
toTextFile=diskusage_out.txt
toYamlFile=diskusage_out.yaml
  ```

where:
```cmd
   pathToScan=D:\_docs
``` 
is a folder or disk name (required)

```cmd
   depth=5
```
is depth of subfolders to analyze (optional)

```cmd
   limit=20
```
is how much biggest folders will be printed in the results (optional)
if you set -limit to 0 it means limitless (no one row be cuted from results). Be warned it might be a huge list of files!
```cmd
   units=Gb
```
you can choose unit style to representing folder sizes. It can be fixed or dynamic-scaled.

If you omit 'units' it means dynamic-scaled units style.

Fixed scale values: b, Kb, Mb, Gb, Tb, Pb.

You can use "units" in case you want to compare sizes afterward (optional).

```cmd
   filterByObjectType=folders&files
```
It is a filter to manage what kind of objects will be selected.

Possible values:
   - files - select only files;
   - folders - select only folders;
   - folders&files - (default) select both of them.

```cmd
   sizeCalculatingMethod=cumulative
```
Possible values (optional):
   - cumulative - (default) sizes of subfolders will be included into size of the parent folder
   - plain - size of subfolders will not be included into size of the parent folder

For example, if your directory tree seems like that:
```cmd
A(100Mb)\B(90Mb)\C(70Mb)
```
and output limit = 2 then
* if sizeCalculatingMethod=cumulative then you get A(100Mb) and B(90Mb) as largest (by syze with nested subfolders)
* if sizeCalculatingMethod=plain then you get B(20Mb) and C(70Mb) as largest (by size without nested subfolders)


```cmd
   toTextFile=diskusage_out.txt
```

File name to save results in human readable format. If value is empty file will not be created and you will see results in console window with prompt to exit at the end.

```cmd
   toYamlFile=diskusage_out.yaml
```
File name for saving results in YAML format for best compatibility with others programs.

Run ```diskusage.exe```
