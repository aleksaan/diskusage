## Features
- A primitive tool for getting folder(s) sizes
- Comfortable setup (yaml config)
- Supports both folders and disks as arguments
- Recursive passes through subfolders
- Calculates size of each folder
- Analyzes on defined depth of subfolders
- Sets limit how much folders will be printed in a results
- Fast
- Saves results to csv-file

## Main cons
- No any dummies protection (also pros)
- No any intelligents features (also pros)

## Releases

Releases available as single executable files â€“ just [download latest release](https://github.com/aleksaan/diskusage/releases) for your platform, unpack and run.

## Simple usage (Windows example)

Put ```diskusage.exe``` into analyzed directory, run it and get results in ```diskusage_out.txt```

* diskusage_config.yaml will be created with a default settings

## Advanced usage (Windows example)

(Optional) Download, create or save ```diskusage_config.yaml``` near ```diskusage.exe```.

Open ```diskusage_config.yaml``` in text editor to setup diskusage

You will see:
```yaml

analyzerOptions: 
  path: 'D:\_docs'
  sizeCalculatingMethod: cumulative
  
filterOptions:
   depth: 5
   limit: 20
   filterByObjectType: folders&files

printerOptions:
  limit: 20
  units: Gb
  toTextFile: diskusage_out.txt
  toYamlFile: diskusage_out.yaml
  ```
where:
```yaml
   path: D:\_docs
``` 
is a folder or disk name (required)

```yaml
   depth: 5
```
is depth of subfolders to analyze (optional)

```yaml
   limit: 20
```
is how much biggest folders will be printed in the results (optional)
if you set -limit to 0 it means limitless (no one row be cuted from results). Be warned it might be a huge list of files!
```yaml
   units: Gb
```
you can choose unit style to representing folder sizes. It can be fixed or dynamic-scaled.

If you omit 'units' it means dynamic-scaled units style.

Fixed scale values: b, Kb, Mb, Gb, Tb, Pb.

You can use "units" in case you want to compare sizes afterward (optional).

```yaml
   printonly: folders&files
```
It is a filter to manage what kind of objects will be printed.

Possible values:
   - files - print only files;
   - folders - print only folders;
   - folders&files - (default) print both of them.

```yaml
hierarchy: Y
```
Possible values (optional):
   - Y - (default) sizes of subfolders will be included into size of the parent folder
   - N - size of subfolders will not be included into size of the parent folder

For example, if your directory tree seems like that:
```cmd
A(100Mb)\B(90Mb)\C(70Mb)
```
and output limit = 2 then
* if hierarchy=Y then you get A(100Mb) and B(90Mb) as largest (by syze with nested subfolders)
* if hierarchy=N then you get B(20Mb) and C(70Mb) as largest (by syze without nested subfolders)


```yaml
   toTextFile: diskusage_out.txt
```

File name to save results in human readable format. If value is empty file will not be created and you will see results in console window with prompt to exit at the end.

```yaml
   toYamlFile: diskusage_out.yaml
```
File name for saving results in YAML format for best compatibility with others programs.

Run ```diskusage.exe```
